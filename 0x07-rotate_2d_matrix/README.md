The "0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix" algorithm is a common problem in coding interviews, particularly for matrix manipulation tasks. The goal is to rotate a given square 2D matrix (N x N) 90 degrees clockwise. This rotation involves transforming the matrix such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.

### Algorithm Overview:
1. **Transpose the Matrix**: The first step is to transpose the matrix, which involves converting rows into columns. For instance, the element at position (i, j) will be moved to position (j, i). This operation can be achieved by swapping the elements symmetrically along the diagonal of the matrix.

2. **Reverse Each Row**: After transposing the matrix, the next step is to reverse each row. This reversal shifts the columns to achieve the 90-degree clockwise rotation. 

### Python Implementation:
Here's a simple implementation in Python:

```python
def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):
    # Transpose the matrix
    n = len(matrix)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]
    
    # Reverse each row
    for i in range(n):
        matrix[i].reverse()
```

### Example:
Given the following matrix:
```
[
 [1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6],
 [7, 8, 9]
]
```
After rotating 90 degrees clockwise, it becomes:
```
[
 [7, 4, 1],
 [8, 5, 2],
 [9, 6, 3]
]
```

### Key Points:
- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm runs in O(N^2) time, where N is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix. This is because both the transpose and row reversal operations require scanning all elements.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) because the rotation is done in-place, meaning no additional space is used beyond the input matrix.

This algorithm is not only efficient but also demonstrates a clear strategy for manipulating data structures in-place, which is a valuable technique in software development.
